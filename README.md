# AWS_IoT_DeviceShadow

## Summary

This project walks you through the process of building an application to mirror the status of IoT devices. The project contains a frontend which displays the current status of your device as well as establishing a connection to AWS IoT. After going through this README you will have the following frontend written in REACT, which you can use to monitor your IoT Device in form of a digital shadow.
